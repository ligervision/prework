# Question 1 - Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" 
# USERNAME is the input of the function. 
# The first line of the code has been defined as below. 


def hello_name(user_name):

# Question 2 - Write a python function, first_odds that prints the 
# odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing 

def first_odds(): 
    if int % 2 == 0:

    print(list(range(0:100)))




# Question 3 - Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to 
# return the max number of a given list. The first line of the 
# code has been defined as below.

def max_num_in_list(a_list):
    for num in a_list:
        if num 



# Question 4 - Write a function to return if the given year is a 
# leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 
# 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be 
# boolean Type (true/false).

    else:
        print("No, this is not a Leap Year")



# Question 5 - Write a function to check to see if all numbers in 
# the list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are 
# consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. 
# The return should be boolean Type.
